I’d like to clarify that the only pending feature at the time of submission was the real-time conversation module. I made sure to submit the assessment before the deadline with all the mandatory requirements completed. Post-deadline, any commits labeled “CHANGES AFTER SUBMISSION” reflect my personal initiative to enhance the project — not out of obligation, but out of commitment to quality and growth. These updates are entirely optional to consider, but I wanted to demonstrate my reliability and dedication to delivering complete, real-world-ready work.

By Monday, I plan to complete the repository with all the bonus tasks as well. In addition to the core functionality, I will be adding:<br>
<br>
-> A well-structured README detailing each feature
<br>
-> In-line code comments across all files
<br>
-> A 1–3 hour in-depth video explanation covering my thought process and implementation
<br>
-> Comprehensive API documentation via Postman
<br><br>
These enhancements are not part of the original assessment requirements. I'm doing them purely for my personal growth — to strengthen my ability to explain code, improve technical documentation skills, and become a better developer overall. This is not an attempt to gain additional credit in the application process, but rather a commitment to continuous learning and improvement.
