I’d like to clarify that the only pending feature at the time of submission was the real-time conversation module. I made sure to submit the assessment before the deadline with all the mandatory requirements completed. Post-deadline, any commits labeled “CHANGES AFTER SUBMISSION” reflect my personal initiative to enhance the project — not out of obligation, but out of commitment to quality and growth. These updates are entirely optional to consider, but I wanted to demonstrate my reliability and dedication to delivering complete, real-world-ready work.
